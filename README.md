# WikiFuzz FuzzBizzer

F# implementation of the classic FizzBuzz "problem". In order not to have to do math the program uses Wikipedia 
to look up divisors. Everyone knows that only developers look at terminals, so the output is displayed in 
Notepad to make things less scary.

## Run environment
* A computer with Windows (implied)
* Google Chrome browser installed on said computer
* Notepad not un-installed on previously mentioned computer
* A very bored operator in front of the now infamous computer

## How to use
1. Compile code
2. Run binary
3. Success!
